## Book

In this folder you can find some solutions to the exercises of this [book](https://www.amazon.it/Algoritmi-Linguaggio-programmazione-soluzioni-commentate/dp/B093RV4XN3/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_it_IT=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=3JI6G8668CK96&keywords=bolelli+vincini&qid=1687543965&sprefix=bolelli+vincini%2Caps%2C208&sr=8-1).

They are divided according to the topic they belong to: each topic has its own folder and each exercise within the topic has its own sub-folder too.

## Class

In this folder you can find some alternative solutions of the examples shown in class.

## Exams

Here you can find some solutions to past exams.

Each exam has its own folder and it's identified by its number on [OLJ](https://olj.ing.unimore.it), which is the platform on which I did the exam. 

Of course, within the exam folder each exercise has its own sub-folder.

## LabExercises 

Here you can find some solutions to the exercises we made during the lab lessons to be ready for the exam. 

Again, each topic has its folder (folders stick to lessons' timetable so if we did two lessons about the same topic there will be two folders). 

## PrimitiveTypes 

For implementation and documentation about primitive types used you can refer to [this repo](https://github.com/prittt/fondamenti-ii)
